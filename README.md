Hello Professor!

My name is Harpreet Mahal and I am a senior. I enjoy using python to analyze data and hope to continue learning more about manipulating data with python in the future. I also enjoy designing. I have always had an interest in both UI and UX. I have designed an app and website for previous courses. I enjoy both the design and coding process.
